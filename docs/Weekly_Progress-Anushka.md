Week 1 [June 13] 
Goals
Getting familiarized with the GitHub Platform and understanding so far what has been done in the nutrition project.

I was able to learn the GitHub platform for code sharing and progress reporting.
I was able to get the overall idea about the project.

What did not go well?
Few parameters / variables were not clear from the datasets.

Did I learn anything important?

Week 2 [June 20] 
Goals
Standardize the datasets using the onboarding tool

What went well?
I was able to standardize the datasets by running the onboarding tool code for renaming the required variables and updating the key-map excel sheet with new variables.
Uploaded the log files to github created for each dataset after running the onboarding tool

What did not go well?
NA

Did I learn anything important?
A lot of time there was data having the same attribute but was named differently. I learnt to keep an eye for such variables in future and not to consider them as new variables.

NA

What urgent questions do I have?
NA

Next step?
Will be discussed on tuesday's meeting.

NA

Did I learn anything important?
NA

What is holding us back?
NA

What urgent questions do I have?
