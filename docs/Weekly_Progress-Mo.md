Week 4 [Jul 1st] 

Ansuhka and Ishrat  shared the onboarded datasets with me and are working on specifying relevant dataset . I merged the scripts and prepared a jupyter file for data preprocessing.The codes had some bugs, I cleaned it and it is ready to be used for data preprocessibng. 

What did not go well?
the codes took time. 

Did I learn anything important? 

What is holding us back? Since we have different datasets with different features, we need to specify relevant datasets. 

What urgent questions do I have?

Next step? Data preprocessing and ,identify the most appropriate target values that will drive our analysis forward by employing different methods, such as correlation matrix analysis.







Week 3 [June 26th] Goals Onboarding tool discussed. Worked with validation script. Ansuhka and Ishrat are done with onboarding dataset. I merged the scripts and prepared a jupyter file for data preprocessing. 

What did not go well? 

Did I learn anything important? I became familiar with the scripts

What is holding us back?

What urgent questions do I have?

Next step? I will run my code on onboarded dataset for data preprocessing




Week 2 [June 19th] 
Goals Onboarding tool discussed. Worked with validation script. Ansuhka and Ishrat are working on different 5 datasets
What did not go well?
I have some questions about my tasks and will discuss them with Candice tomorrow.(regarding tool and datasets)

Did I learn anything important?
  I did literature review on existing analysing methods 

What is holding us back?
