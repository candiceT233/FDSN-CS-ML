### Week 5 [Jul 10th] :white_check_mark:
**Goals**
- The key elements and preprocessing scripts are cleaned, merged, and pushed to GitHub. The dataset is preprocessed and pushed to Github for the next steps. The next steps and tasks are discussed with Ishrat and Anushka. The step at this point is to find the target variables per related datasets, feature engineering, and then deploy analysis methods.
  
**What went well?**
- data preprocessing
  
**What did not go well?**
- keymap had to be cleaned. I did and pushed to github
  
**Did I learn anything important?**
- N/A
  
**What is holding us back?**
- N/A
  
**What urgent questions do I have?**
- N/A
  
**Next step?**
- Working on the preprocessed dataset to find target variable, feature engineering, and then apply ML/DL model


Week 4 [Jul 1st] 

Ansuhka and Ishrat  shared the onboarded datasets with me and are working on specifying relevant dataset . I merged the scripts and prepared a jupyter file for data preprocessing.The codes had some bugs, I cleaned it and it is ready to be used for data preprocessibng. 

What did not go well?
the codes took time. 

Did I learn anything important? 

What is holding us back? Since we have different datasets with different features, we need to specify relevant datasets. 

What urgent questions do I have?

Next step? Data preprocessing and ,identify the most appropriate target values that will drive our analysis forward by employing different methods, such as correlation matrix analysis.







Week 3 [June 26th] Goals Onboarding tool discussed. Worked with validation script. Ansuhka and Ishrat are done with onboarding dataset. I merged the scripts and prepared a jupyter file for data preprocessing. 

What did not go well? 

Did I learn anything important? I became familiar with the scripts

What is holding us back?

What urgent questions do I have?

Next step? I will run my code on onboarded dataset for data preprocessing




Week 2 [June 19th] 
Goals Onboarding tool discussed. Worked with validation script. Ansuhka and Ishrat are working on different 5 datasets
What did not go well?
I have some questions about my tasks and will discuss them with Candice tomorrow.(regarding tool and datasets)

Did I learn anything important?
  I did literature review on existing analysing methods 

What is holding us back?

What urgent questions do I have?

Next step?
  Discuss Tasks with Candice
  Working on the tasks assigned to me
