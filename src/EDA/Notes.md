## Processing steps

* Filter dataset by type/category
* Remove columns with 80% Nulls
* Label encode some columns
* Drop some columns such as subject, ID etc
* fix data type inconsistency
* Imputation (WIP)
* Normalize
* Correlation matrix
* identify string corelations
* perform sperman correlation technique
* identify strong correlations again
* calculate t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visulize
* k means clustering to get important features


## Issues

* Imputation technique to use for attributes with 50% or less nulls?
* Time, IL10 (pg/ml) and similar ones have datatype inconsistency
* Date attribute not handled
