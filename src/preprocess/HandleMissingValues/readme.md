The provided code snippet defines a function handle_missing_values() that handles missing values in a given DataFrame. Here's a write-up explaining the code:

The handle_missing_values() function takes a single parameter data, which represents the DataFrame containing missing values.

Within the function, the following steps are performed to handle missing values:

    Initializing the imputer: The code initializes a SimpleImputer object from the sklearn.impute module with the strategy set to 'mean'. This imputer will replace missing values with the mean of each respective column.

    Performing mean imputation: The fit_transform() method of the imputer is used to perform mean imputation on the data DataFrame. This replaces all missing values with the mean value of each column.

    Converting the imputed data to a DataFrame: The imputed data, which is in the form of an array, is converted back to a DataFrame using the pd.DataFrame() constructor. The column names are preserved by passing data.columns as the columns parameter.

    Returning the imputed DataFrame: The imputed DataFrame, imputed_df, is returned from the function.

The purpose of this function is to handle missing values in a DataFrame using the mean imputation strategy. Missing values can occur in datasets for various reasons, and imputation techniques aim to fill in these missing values with reasonable estimates to ensure the integrity and usefulness of the data.

Overall, this code snippet showcases the use of the SimpleImputer class from the scikit-learn library to handle missing values by replacing them with the mean of each column. It provides a simple and effective method to address missing data, allowing for further analysis or model training on complete datasets.
