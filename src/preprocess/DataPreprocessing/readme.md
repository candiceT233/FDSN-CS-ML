The preprocess_data() function takes a folder path containing Excel files, identifies the common attributes, performs data preprocessing steps, and saves the preprocessed DataFrames as Excel files in an output folder.

Here's a writeup for this code:

The preprocess_data() function is designed to preprocess data from multiple Excel files within a specified folder. Here's an overview of how it works:

    The function takes three parameters: folder_path, common_attributes, and output_folder.
        folder_path is the path to the folder containing the Excel files to be processed.
        common_attributes is a list of common attributes that will be selected from each Excel file.
        output_folder is the folder where the preprocessed Excel files will be saved.

    Inside the function, an empty list preprocessed_dfs is created to store the preprocessed DataFrames.

    The function iterates over the files in the folder_path using os.listdir().

    For each file that ends with the ".xlsx" extension, the file paths for input and output are constructed using os.path.join().

    The Excel file is read into a DataFrame using pd.read_excel().

    Only the common attributes specified in common_attributes are selected from the DataFrame using df[list(common_attributes)].

    Additional preprocessing steps can be performed on the DataFrame if needed.
        You can add code here to handle missing values, perform data transformations, standardize column names, etc.

    The preprocessed DataFrame is saved as an Excel file using df.to_excel(output_file_path, index=False).
        index=False ensures that the row indices are not included in the output file.

    A message is printed to indicate the location where the preprocessed data is saved.

    The preprocessed DataFrame is appended to the preprocessed_dfs list.

    After processing all the Excel files, the function returns the list of preprocessed DataFrames.

This function provides a convenient way to preprocess multiple Excel files, select common attributes, and save the preprocessed data for further analysis or modeling. By specifying the output_folder, you can easily organize and access the preprocessed files.

Remember to provide the appropriate arguments when calling the preprocess_data() function, such as the folder_path, common_attributes, and output_folder.
