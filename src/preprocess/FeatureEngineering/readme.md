The provided code snippet defines a function perform_feature_engineering() that applies feature engineering operations on a combined DataFrame. Here's a write-up explaining the code:

The perform_feature_engineering() function takes a single parameter combined_df, which represents the combined DataFrame on which the feature engineering operations will be performed.

Within the function, several feature engineering operations are demonstrated:

    Creating a new feature: The code snippet shows an example of creating a new feature named 'NewFeature' by combining the values of 'Feature1' and 'Feature2' using the + operator. This allows for the creation of derived features based on existing ones.

    Transforming a numeric feature: The code applies a transformation to the 'NumericFeature' column using the apply() method. In this example, the transformation is squaring the values of the numeric feature by raising them to the power of 2. This showcases the ability to perform mathematical transformations on numeric features.

    One-hot encoding a categorical feature: The pd.get_dummies() function is used to perform one-hot encoding on the 'CategoricalFeature' column. This process converts categorical variables into binary columns, where each category has its own binary column with values indicating the presence or absence of the category. This is a common technique to handle categorical variables in machine learning models.

Finally, the updated combined DataFrame is returned from the function.

The purpose of this function is to demonstrate how to apply various feature engineering techniques to the combined DataFrame. Feature engineering plays a crucial role in preparing data for machine learning models by creating new features, transforming existing ones, and encoding categorical variables to make them suitable for analysis or model training.

Overall, this code snippet provides an example of feature engineering operations that can be applied to a combined DataFrame, highlighting the flexibility and versatility of pandas for data manipulation and transformation tasks.
