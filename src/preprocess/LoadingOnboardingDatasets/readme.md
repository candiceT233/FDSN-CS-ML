The provided code snippet defines a function combine_excel_files() that combines multiple Excel files into a single DataFrame. Here's a write-up explaining the code:

The combine_excel_files() function takes a single parameter folder_path, which represents the path to the folder containing the Excel files to be combined.

Within the function, the following steps are performed to combine the Excel files:

    Initializing an empty list: The code initializes an empty list dfs to store the DataFrames read from each Excel file.

    Iterating over the files in the folder: The os.listdir() function is used to iterate over the files in the specified folder_path. For each file, the code checks if it has the ".xlsx" extension.

    Reading Excel files into DataFrames: The pd.read_excel() function is used to read each Excel file into a DataFrame. The file path is constructed using os.path.join() by combining the folder_path and the current file name.

    Appending DataFrames to the list: The DataFrame read from each Excel file is appended to the dfs list.

    Combining DataFrames: The pd.concat() function is used to concatenate all the DataFrames in the dfs list into a single DataFrame. This combines the rows from each DataFrame into a unified DataFrame.

    Returning the combined DataFrame: The combined DataFrame is returned from the function.

The purpose of this function is to simplify the process of combining multiple Excel files into a single DataFrame. It iterates over the files in the specified folder, reads each file as a DataFrame, and concatenates them together to create a consolidated DataFrame.

Overall, this code snippet showcases the use of the os module to iterate over files in a directory and the pd.read_excel() function to read Excel files into DataFrames. The pd.concat() function is then used to combine the DataFrames into a single DataFrame, enabling further analysis or processing on the consolidated data.
