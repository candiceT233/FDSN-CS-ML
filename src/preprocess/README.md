## Set up environments
To set up the environment for running the code, you can follow these steps:

### Folder Structure:

1. Create a new folder for your project, e.g., "ml-project".
2. Inside the "ml-project" folder, create a subfolder named "Datashare".
3. Place all the Excel files that you want to combine in the "Datashare" folder.

### Required Starter Datasets:

1. Ensure that you have the required starter datasets in the "Datashare" folder.
2. The code assumes that the Excel files contain the required columns specified in the columns_to_filter list.
3. Modify the columns_to_filter list if needed to match the column names in your datasets.

### Install Dependencies:

1. Ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your system.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal.

3. Navigate to the "ml-project" folder using the cd command.

4. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    python -m venv env
5. Activate the virtual environment:
    For Windows:

        env\Scripts\activate

    For macOS/Linux:
        source env/bin/activate

6. Install the required dependencies:
    pip install pandas scikit-learn

7. Run the Code:

In the command prompt or terminal, make sure you are in the "ml-project" folder and the virtual environment is activated (if applicable).

8. Run the Python script:
    python main.py

The code will prompt you for input and perform the necessary steps as defined in the code.Follow the on-screen instructions and provide the requested information.The combined and processed dataset will be exported to an Excel file named "processed_dataset.xlsx" in the same folder.

## Folder Structures:
Creating a well-organized folder structure is essential for managing and organizing your project's files and resources. Here's a suggested folder structure that you can use as a starting point:

## Overview of the Project:
The project focuses on data processing and modeling using machine learning techniques. It involves steps such as data onboarding, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation. Here is a simple overall diagram illustrating the flow of the project:

              +-------------------+
              |    Onboard Data   |
              +-------------------+
                        |
                        v
              +-------------------+
              |   Preprocessing   |
              +-------------------+
                        |
                        v
              +-------------------+
              | Feature Engineering|
              +-------------------+
                        |
                        v
              +-------------------+
              |  Model Training   |
              +-------------------+
                        |
                        v
              +-------------------+
              | Model Evaluation  |
              +-------------------+

### Onboard Data:
In this step, the project begins by acquiring or onboarding the necessary datasets. These datasets could be obtained from various sources such as files, databases, APIs, etc.
### Preprocessing:
The preprocessing step involves cleaning and transforming the raw data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling.
Common preprocessing tasks include handling missing values, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
### Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the data.
It involves techniques such as creating interaction terms, polynomial features, encoding temporal or spatial information, and extracting meaningful features from text or images.
### Model Training:
After preprocessing and feature engineering, the data is split into training and testing sets.
Machine learning models are then trained on the training set using algorithms such as regression, classification, or clustering.
The models learn patterns and relationships in the data to make predictions or extract insights.
### Model Evaluation:
Once the models are trained, they are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or mean squared error.
Evaluation helps assess the performance and effectiveness of the models.
Techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning may be applied to fine-tune the models for better performance.

The project also involves additional steps such as exporting datasets, writing reports, and potentially deploying the trained models in real-world applications. The folder structure and starter datasets mentioned earlier provide a framework and initial data resources to support the project's implementation and organization.

## Dependencies Used

1. os: The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system. It is used in this code to perform operations such as joining file paths and listing files in a directory.
